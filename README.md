# Social and Political Factors of Climate Change

The human impact on climate change has been undeniable. As such, we cannot afford to ignore the social and political influences of this issue. In this project, we primarily focus on exploring the relationship between the American people's opinions on climate change and how they relate with greenhouse gas emissions and political party affiliation. Specifically, we build regression models to examine how climate change opinion relates with political party affiliation and to predict climate change opinion from greenhouse gas emissions and temperature. Our analysis primarily focuses on stratifying and analyzing each state in America. To predict climate change opinion, we found that random forest performs the best and SVM performs the worst. To predict political party affiliation, we found that linear regression performs the best and random forest performs the worst.
